Hello, my name is Anton Pritchett and I'm a junior here at Lewis and I'm a Psychology major. As for my focus in Psychology, I'm not completely sold on anything yet but that's all part of being in college.
Last semester I was looking for a possible minor and stumbled upon Computer Science and pretty much enjoyed it, so now I'm working to get enough credits to either minor or double major in it.
As for hobbies I, like video games, anime, Hulu, and going out with my friends on weekends, cause school is too important...right?
